# BooleanAlgebraPractice

- Has XOR functionality but not used (prep for A-Level mode)

TODO
- More intermediate columns in truth table mode eg Q = (A AND (NOT B)) OR C only makes NOT B - I think it's just first level.  May cause issues for level 4 truth tables
- Replace correct/incorrect in answers with emoji/symbol? Some draw circuit mode replies are too long
- Name that level 2 + 3 pick from level 2 + 3 expressions combined - come up with level 3 no overlap
- Scenario mode - checkboxes to enable modes?
- For A-Level
  - KMap support
  - Multiple outputs on draw circuit mode - draw half/full adders
