# BooleanAlgebraPractice

- Has XOR functionality but not used (prep for A-Level mode)

TODO
- More intermediate columns in truth table mode eg Q = (A AND (NOT B)) OR C only makes NOT B - I think it's just first level.  May cause issues for level 4 truth tables
- Scenario mode - 30 bonus pixels under the table - why?
- Replace correct/incorrect in answers with emoji/symbol? Some draw circuit mode replies are too long

Modes
- Pick that logic gate - multiple choice questions. Shows expression and multiple logic gates to pick which one it is
- Pick that expression - show a truth table, which expression does it represent?
- Combined mode - shows a scenario, and asks for truth table or expression or circuit


Name that mode
- Currently - name that gate. Multiple choice, shows a gate, user has to pick basic gate it is AND / OR / NOT / NONE
- Level 2 / Name that circuit - show a circuit with 2-3 gates (any of the level 2-3 circuits), show 4 possible answers, user picks which one
- Level 3 / Name that expression - show a level 2-3 truth table, show 4 possible expressions, user picks which one
