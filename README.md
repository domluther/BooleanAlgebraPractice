# BooleanAlgebraPractice

TODO
- Scoring needs thought - last thing to do?
- Layout of difficulty level + toggles - especially on truth table when multiple toggles
- Name that gate buttons
- More intermediate columns in truth table mode eg Q = (A AND (NOT B)) OR C only makes NOT B - I think it's just first level.  May cause issues for level 4 truth tables
- What do I want when people get questions wrong? Can they try again? Truth Table hiding feedback issues due to resetUIState
- Circuit generator turned Q = (B or C) OR A  into a straight line cos lower case or. Make it so it's capitalised?


Modes
- Pick that logic gate - multiple choice questions. Shows expression and multiple logic gates to pick which one it is
- Pick that expression - show a truth table, which expression does it represent?
- Combined mode - shows a scenario, and asks for truth table or expression or circuit


Name that mode
- Currently - name that gate. Multiple choice, shows a gate, user has to pick basic gate it is AND / OR / NOT / NONE
- Level 2 / Name that circuit - show a circuit with 2-3 gates (any of the level 2-3 circuits), show 4 possible answers, user picks which one
- Level 3 / Name that expression - show a level 2-3 truth table, show 4 possible expressions, user picks which one
