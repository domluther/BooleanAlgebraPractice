# BooleanAlgebraPractice

TODO
- Scoring needs thought - last thing to do?
- Layout of difficulty level + toggles - especially on truth table when multiple toggles
- Name that gate buttons
- Truth table questions - say that output is Q
- Truth table - level 3 scenarios more complex tables see past paper question about motion sensors
  
Modes
- Draw logic diagram/circuit/system mode
- Pick that logic gate - multiple choice questions. Shows expression and multiple logic gates to pick which one it is
- Pick that expression - show a truth table, which expression does it represent?
- Combined mode - shows a scenario, and asks for truth table or expression or circuit
