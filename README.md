# BooleanAlgebraPractice

TODO
- Level 1 circuit generation so they're neater when only one gate?
  - This would make it neater when used in truth table mode
- Refactor generate write expression mode down to a simple expression - no need for one for each level now expressionDatabase exists 
- Scoring needs thought - last thing to do?
- Layout of difficulty level + toggles - especially on truth table when multiple toggles
- Name that gate buttons
- Truth table questions - say that output is Q
- Truth table - level 3 scenarios more complex tables see past paper question about motion sensors
  
Modes
- Draw circuit mode
- Pick that logic gate - multiple choice questions. Shows expression and multiple logic gates to pick which one it is
- Pick that expression - show a truth table, which expression does it represent?
-
