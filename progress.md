JavaScript Refactoring Plan - Updated Status
Current File Structure & Purpose
Core Application Files

app.js ‚úÖ - Main application bootstrap and initialization
config.js ‚úÖ - Application configuration, mode settings, constants
game-manager.js ‚úÖ - Game mode switching, scoring, central state management
ui-manager.js ‚úÖ - High-level UI state orchestration and workflow management
ui-setup.js ‚úÖ - Initial UI generation (mode buttons, difficulty dropdowns, event listeners)

Game Mode Files

name-that-gate.js ‚úÖ - Name That Gate mode logic
expression-writing.js ‚úÖ - Expression Writing mode logic
truth-table.js ‚úÖ - Truth Table mode logic
draw-circuit.js ‚úÖ - Draw Circuit mode logic (interactive canvas-based circuit building)
scenario.js ‚úÖ - Scenario mode logic (real-world Boolean logic problems)

Utility Files

circuit-generator.js ‚úÖ - SVG circuit generation and rendering
expression-utils.js ‚úÖ - Expression parsing, validation, and manipulation utilities
data.js ‚úÖ - Expression database and static data

Supporting Files

navigation.js - Site navigation dropdown functionality (needs review)
score-manager.js - Score tracking, persistence, and statistics (needs review)


Completed Work ‚úÖ
Phase 1: Extract Utilities ‚úÖ

CircuitGenerator class extracted to its own file
Static data moved to separate data.js file
Expression parsing/validation functions extracted to expression-utils.js

Phase 2: Extract Game Modes ‚úÖ

All 5 game modes extracted to dedicated files
Proper module exports/imports implemented
Mode-specific functionality isolated

Phase 3: Refactor Core ‚úÖ (Mostly Complete)

Created config.js for centralized configuration
Refactored game-manager.js to use config and standardized dependency injection
Created ui-setup.js for UI generation logic
Cleaned up app.js to focus on application bootstrap


Phase 4: Constructor Standardization ‚úÖ
DrawCircuit has different constructor signature. This was considered unimportant as it is functional.

DrawCircuit: constructor(dependencies)
All others: constructor(circuitGenerator, dependencies)

Remaining Work & Future Explorations

Phase 5: Supporting Files Review üîç
Files that need examination:

navigation.js - Determine if this fits the new architecture
score-manager.js - Review integration with game-manager.js state management

Phase 7: Final Cleanup & Polish üßπ
Tasks:

Remove all remaining TODO comments
Ensure consistent coding patterns across all files
Verify all imports/exports are optimized
Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation where missing
Consider lazy loading for game modes (performance optimization)


Immediate Next Steps

Review navigation.js and score-manager.js - Determine their role in the new architecture


Long-term Considerations
Performance Optimizations

Consider lazy loading game modes only when needed
Optimize circuit generation for complex expressions
Cache frequently used DOM elements

Maintainability Improvements

Standardize error handling patterns across all modules
Implement consistent logging/debugging utilities
Consider adding unit tests for core utilities

Feature Extensibility

Design pattern makes adding new game modes straightforward
Configuration-driven approach allows easy mode customization
Modular structure supports independent feature development
