JavaScript Refactoring Plan
Proposed File Structure
Core Application Files
* app.js - Main application initialization and global state management
* game-manager.js - Game mode switching, scoring, UI state management
* ui-utils.js - Common UI utilities (feedback, buttons, scoring display)
Game Mode Files
* name-that-gate.js - Name That Gate mode logic
* expression-writing.js - Expression Writing mode logic
* truth-table.js - Truth Table mode logic
* draw-circuit.js - Draw Circuit mode logic
* scenario.js - Scenario mode logic
Utility Files
* circuit-generator.js - SVG circuit generation class
* expression-utils.js - Expression parsing and validation utilities
* data.js - Expression database and static data
Key Benefits of This Structure
1. Separation of Concerns
Each file has a single, clear responsibility:
* Game modes are isolated from each other
* UI logic is separated from game logic
* Utility functions are reusable across modes
2. Maintainability
* Easy to find and modify specific functionality
* Reduced risk of breaking unrelated features when making changes
* Clear dependencies between modules
3. Scalability
* Easy to add new game modes without touching existing code
* Simple to extend or modify individual features
* Better organization for team development
4. Testing
* Each module can be unit tested independently
* Easier to mock dependencies
* More focused test files
Refactoring Plan
Phase 1: Extract Utilities

✅ Move CircuitGenerator class to its own file
✅ Move static data (expression database) to separate file
✅ Extract expression parsing/validation functions

Phase 2: Extract Game Modes (in progress)

✅Start with simpler modes (Name That Gate, Expression Writing, Scenario)
Move each mode's functions to dedicated files
Ensure proper module exports/imports

Phase 3: Refactor Core (upcoming)

Create centralized game manager
Extract common UI utilities
Clean up main app initialization
